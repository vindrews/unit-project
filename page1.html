	<h2>GLaDOS's Psyche</h2>
	
	<h5>
	<p> To understand portal, it is important to understand GLaDOS's motivations. In the first game, GLaDOS is antagonistic towards Chell, the player. The reasoning for this has been confirmed by the developers to be because she was falling in love with Chell, and didn't know what to do about it. She was a robot, designed for one thing: testing. Chell proved to be the perfect test subject, moving through her puzzles with ease. She started to fall in love with Chell, but wasn't programmed to process emotions like that. She acted out in violence towards Chell as a response to this, becoming more antagonistic as a defense mechanism. When Chell escapes at the end of the game, she grows desperate, begging her to come back as she runs away, and then resorting to attacking her as Chell tries to take her apart. She gets her heart broken in Portal 1, which makes her actions in Portal 2 make even more sense. </p>

	<h5>
	<p>In Portal 2, once GLaDOS is awoken by Wheatley and Chell, she begins to fall back in love with Chell again. She is initially furious with Chell, forcing her to complete more tests, her antagonistic dialog at an all-time high. But, once Chell switches Wheatley into control of the facility, and GLaDOS is forced into a potato, she begins to soften, slightly. She is still antagonistic, but something crucial has changed. Now, she has to be on the same team as Chell if she wants to survive. She hates it at first, but after spending time with her mute test subject, she begins to remember why she fell in love in the first place. She never stops being antagonistic, but at a certain point her dialog becomes more familiar, more friendly, even.</p>
	</h5>
	
	<h5>
	<p> There is a more specific catalyst for her falling back in love, and also for her growing slightly more friendly. As they explore the older parts of the facility together, there is a voice occasionally making announcements on the intercom. His name is Cave Johnson, and he was the original founder of the laboratory they are in. GLaDOS recognizes his voice immediately, but doesn't quite know how. In one recording that plays, Cave has his assistant come say something on the announcements (More specifically, she says, "Yes, Mr. Johnson!), and GLaDOS- seemingly institutionally- responds perfectly in time with her. She doesn't know why she did this, and is extremely creeped out by it at first. Later on, her and Chell find a painting of Cave Johnson and that assistant, and GLaDOS becomes even more creeped out it. Eventaully the player figures out, with dialog clues from the announcements, that Cave's assistant was put into a robot, and that robot was GLaDOS. This quickly recontextualizes almost everything that GLaDOS has done. Her ability to fall in love with Chell is explained by this sliver of humanity that she has, and her inability to understand it and consequent antagonistic behavior could be explained by her robotic "brain" being unable to process human emotions. </p>
