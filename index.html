<h2><b>What is Portal?</b></h2>

<h5>
<p>Portal is a game made by the video game company "Valve." They are most well known for making the Half-Life game series, which is often credited for being one of the catalysts in the formation of the first-person shooter genre of gaming. Half-Life came out in 1998, and takes place in a facility called "Black Mesa Science," which is quickly destroyed by the player messing up an experiment. This event causes aliens to come to Earth, and the player's goal is to defeat them. This game was wildly successful, and after it's sequel came out, the game company branched out to make new things.</p>

<p> A few years later, after the release of Half-Life 2, Valve released a new game, called Portal. It was made in the source engine, just as their other games were. The game was, at first glance, basically just retextured Half-Life 2. And it pretty much was, in terms of mechanics. To this day, if you open Portal 1 on your computer, it will show up as Half-Life 2 in your task bar. Despite this, the games were <i> very</i> different. In portal, the player wakes up in a small glass test chamber, with one white wall in it. The player sees a portal open up on that white wall, then on the wall outside the chamber they see another portal open up. Because of the placements of the portals, the player is actually able to see themselves. This was a genius move in terms of game design, because in early development the players would often see a portal and not connect that it was merely transporting them to another portal in the same room, and instead thought it was taking them to another dimension. By allowing the player to see themselves in the Portal, they were able to make the connection that they weren't being transported to another dimension immediately. There are countless examples of intuitive game design like this in both Portal games, but to list them would require a new website entirely.</p>

<p>As the player (Named Chell in game) navigates through the game, they quickly piece together that they are a test subject at "Aperture Laboratories," both by examining their surroundings and by the robotic woman's voice speaking to them as they go through the tests. The robot's name is GLaDOS (which is an acronym for "Genetic Lifeform and Disk Operating System"), and she is the scientist in charge of overseeing not only the player's testing, but also every test happening in the facility. She is hostile towards the player throughout the game, seemingly harboring some kind of bitter hatred for humans in general. The player starts to notice writings on the walls in slightly hidden parts of the game's map, and they slowly start to piece together that GLaDOS is dangerous, and they need to escape. The player diverges from the testing course, beginning their escape. As GLaDOS notices this, she begins to plead with the player, begging them to come back, even offering them a cake and a party if they were to just come back and test with her. The player eventually arrives in the chamber that GLaDOS' body is kept in, and they must fight her in order to get to an elevator to the surface and escape. GLaDOS releases a deadly neurotoxin into the room, giving the player about 5 minutes to escape before the neurotoxin kills them. The player destroys GLaDOS by ripping parts of her robotic body off of her and incinerating them. The credits for the first game roll, and the player hears GLaDOS singing a song titled "Still Alive," where she talks about how she is still living, and in fact sees everything that happened as a triumph. She is definitely being sarcastic in the song as she talks about how she's not even angry, even though you "broke her heart and killed her." The credits finish rolling and the player sees a disheartening end credits sequence. It shows that once the player reaches the surface, they fall over from exhaustion and inhalation of the neurotoxins. They are pulled back into the facility by an unknown force, and put to sleep in a "long relaxation chamber," where they stay sleeping for between 50 and 50,000 years. The next time they wake up is at the start of the second game.</p>

<p>When Chell awakens from that rest in Portal 2, the room has completely deteriorated from being left untouched for years. The facility appears to have slowly fallen apart without GLaDOS being alive to keep it in check. Soon after the player wakes up, they hear a knock on the door to their chamber. A British robot orb that is hanging from the ceiling greets them, telling the player that he is going to help them escape! Together they make their way through the dilapidated remains of Aperture Labs, and eventually find their way back to GLaDOS' chamber. Through the robot (Wheatley) being an absolute idiot, GLaDOS is awoken again. She immediately throws Wheatley away, and puts Chell back into the test chambers. </p>
